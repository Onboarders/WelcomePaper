# ﻿🛡️﻿ Service Guilds
Get assigned to the appropriate guild by joining the discord (onbaorddao.org/discord) and selecting the appropriate emoji in the #🛡️-choose-your-guilds channel
## ﻿👋﻿ Customer Acquisition (HELLO GUILD)
The HELLO guild is the first touch point dedicated to acquiring users for platforms. This guild is dedicated to onboarding users (customer acquisition). Onboarding challenges will be facilitated by the HELLO guild.
## ﻿💬﻿ Customer Service (SUPPORT GUILD)
We work face to face IRL+URL to make sure users are onboarded to your ecosystem, dApp, or product answering questions. creating support tickets of interactions relaying any issue directly to the appropriate Product Managers.
## ﻿🔍﻿ User Research (UX GUILD)
Web3 is an industry that is constantly innovating back end technology but often neglects critical User Experience research and audits to create the necessary flows to onboard the next billion users. Outside of having our UX Researchers conducting user interviews & beta test, as we onboard to Products, our shop of UI/UX Designers can develop mobile first designs for your Web3 dApp.
## ﻿🤝﻿ Business Development (BD GUILD)
We will onboard projects / partners to your chain and ecosystem. We intro partnerships, helping facilitate deal flow. Primarily operating out of referral agreements.
## ﻿🎒﻿Education (LEARN GUILD)
Education on onboard to wallets, using NFTs, setting up DAO's through workshops and activations. LEARN guild will primarily be responsible for creating tutorials, documentation, as well as facilitating workshops.
## ﻿🕸️﻿ Quality Assurance (QA GUILD)
This service is especially for applications that are in alpha + beta phase. Outside of User Q/A testing, our guild of QA Engineers. As part of this guild we plan to submit report directly to protocols but also work directly with auditors and bug bounty programs to get critical vulnerabilities addressed by the white hat community.
## ﻿👔﻿ Talent Sourcing (JOBS GUILD)
Leverage our onboarding flow to effectively place talent into roles in #Web3. JOBS GUILD will be responsible for finding job opportunities as well as qualified candidates to fill these positions. This may take the form as posting and referrals or direct sourcing, screening, and onboarding similar to a talent agency. 
## ﻿📣﻿ Outreach/Marketing (HYPE Guild)
This guild is the defacto "Marketing " guild. Although we do not want to evolve into a marketing agency, this guild will be working closely with all other guilds to get official messaging out, especially with the Hello Guild to help with customer acquisition. Additionally the outreach guild will be responsible for developing graphics, copy, scheduled posts, and direct engagement (outside of customer support) on official Onboard DAO Social Media Channels.
## ﻿🛠️﻿ Builders (BUILD GUILD)
The primary purpose of the Build Guild is to unite and onboard developers. With a hyperfocus on helping build open source onboarding tools and assisting onboard DAO with operational development needs. This may come in the form of send funds to dev who want to deploy contracts on mainnet who may not have the funds to deploy or do not want to go to centralized solutions to gain funds for deploying their contracts. As part of this service developers can also allocate a portion of their 30% contract fee earnings to the Onboard DAO astro DAO contract.
## ﻿🖌️﻿ Artists (CREATE GUILD)
We provide initial mint funds for artists beginning to bring their portfolio on chain. The CREATE guild will also be responsible for developing assets, recruiting artists, outside of the traditional product designers from the UX Guild.

#﻿❓﻿ Questions To Consider?
- What are the early roles that are needed (operator? biz dev / partnerships / sales? marketing/social media manager?) How will those members be incentivized before funding?
- How are we going to streamline partnerships and quantify this for partners?
- How will we setup retainers to be customer service arms for protocols?
- Outside the NEAR Ecosystem what will be our onboarding capacity
- Who will be main beneficiaries? NEAR Foundation? Projects on retainers? NEAR Digital Collective? Marketing Guild?
- What will be done on Astro DAO vs Wonderverse?
- What is the membership and workflow process for Service guilds?
- How will we effectively quantify contributions across different verticals and put it on chain?
- What are the main communication channels that would be effective for this? (Defaulted to telegram)
- For initial user feedback we are going to start by creating feedback channels for each product in the Feedback category of the discord onboarddao.org/discord
